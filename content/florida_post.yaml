You'll find plenty of natural beauty when visiting Clay County. The region is known for its <a href=\"https://www.visitflorida.com/en-us/cities/st-augustine/clay-county-florida.html\">scenic locations</a> like the St. Johns River, Black Creek, and Penney Farms.</p>\n<p>While Clay County isn't as prone to flooding as its coastal neighbors, the area still has several regions that pose flood risks. Clay County is known as \"<a href=\"https://www.news4jax.com/news/local/2020/06/08/residents-brace-for-flooding-in-clay-county-after-emergency-management-warning/\">one of the most infamous spots for flooding in Northeast Florida</a>,\" in large part because of its poor drainage.

There are two high-risk flood zones in Gadsden County:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Flood zone A.</li>\n<li>Flood zone AE.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A and AE flood zones have a one percent annual chance of flooding and a 26 percent chance of flooding during a 30-year mortgage period. An A flood zone has a 100-year floodplain with no determinable base flood elevation (BFE), while AE zones have a 100-year floodplain with determinable BFEs.</p>\n<p>BFE is the height to which a flood is expected to rise during a base flood. A base flood, also called a 100-year flood, is a flood that has a one percent chance of exceeding base elevation in any given year.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatdoesgadsdencountyfloodinsurancecover\">What Does Gadsden County Flood Insurance Cover?</h2>\n<p>Flood insurance pays for repairs and replacements when floods, groundwater seepage, or broken water mains damage your home, belongings, or other structures.

If you’re looking to get away from the noise, Glades County offers excellent fishing, quiet backroads, and plenty of opportunities for scenic photographs.</p>\n<p>Florida residents have to face the possibility of floods, and Glades County is no exception. Flood risks are continually on the rise because of climate change. Several high-risk flood zones in Glades County make <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance</a> a smart idea. After all, homeowners insurance doesn’t cover flood damage, and the Okeechobee River and Glades County’s various canals are prime catalysts for floods when prolonged rainfall, hurricanes, or tropical storms occur.</p>\n<p>While the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) used to be Florida’s only option for flood protection, we're proud to offer cheaper flood insurance rates for Glades County homeowners.</p>\n<h2 id=\"gladescountyfloodinsurancecosts\">Glades County Flood Insurance Costs</h2>\n<p>Our average flood insurance rate is $221 for Glades County homeowners.

You should also consider service.</p>\n<p>For example, with the NFIP, you must have an elevation certificate and wait 30 days for your coverage to take effect. With us, your coverage is effective immediately and you can add it onto your homeowners policy. No juggling two policies, two premiums, and two deductibles.

That means if your home experiences a flood, your coverage can help pay to repair or replace:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cabinets and paneling.</li>\n<li>Personal property.</li>\n<li>Appliances.</li>\n<li>Carpets and window treatments.</li>\n<li>Electrical, cooling, heating, and plumbing systems.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>—and more!</p>\n<p>But flood insurance can’t cover everything. Typically, it excludes coverage for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Boathouses.</li>\n<li>Fences or retaining walls.</li>\n<li>Pools or pool equipment.</li>\n<li>Landscaping.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"findoutyourhomesfloodriskingulfcounty\">Find Out Your Home’s Flood Risk in Gulf County</h2>\n<p>The first step to determining your flood risk is to look at FEMA’s flood maps. You can also look up your address on a site like Flood Factor to see your home’s flood outlook.</p>\n<p>For example, Flood Factor shows that <a href=\"https://floodfactor.com/zip/32456/32456_fsid\">69 percent of properties in Port St. Joe</a> are at risk for flooding. Of those, 6.7 percent are at extreme risk of flooding. Its model shows that for this small beach town, 4951 properties were impacted by Hurricane Michael's storm surge in October, 2018.</p>\n<p>Once you understand your home's flood risks, you can take active measures to <a href=\"/blog/6-tips-for-flood-risk/\">lower your home's risk of flooding</a>, which can translate to a lower flood insurance premium.</p>"

    body: "<h2 id=\"howtogetfloodinsuranceinhamiltoncountyflorida\">How to Get Flood Insurance in Hamilton County, Florida</h2>\n<p>Hamilton County is near Florida’s border with Georgia, a proximity that’s earned the region the nickname “Florida's Front Porch.” The Suwannee River borders the eastern and southern portions of Hamilton County while the Withlacoochee River borders the county's western portion. But one river in particular makes Hamilton County unique.</p>\n<p>The Alapaha River runs from Georgia through Hamilton County, traveling south to the Suwannee River. When the Alapaha River meets Hamilton County, it travels underground and remains dry for a large portion of the year.</p>\n<p>Hamilton County's various ponds, lakes, and bays only add to the flooding threats that the county faces from its major rivers. While the county is inland, <a href=\"https://www.fema.gov/media-library-data/20130726-1803-25045-8083/st_broomein.pdf\">20 to 25 percent</a> of flood claims occur outside of high-risk flood zones.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">Flood insurance</a> is a smart investment in this area. Let’s see how much flood insurance costs, who needs it, and what it covers.</p>\n<h2 id=\"hamiltoncountyfloodinsurancecosts\">Hamilton County Flood Insurance Costs</h2>\n<p>On average, our flood insurance costs $127 a year for Hamilton County. By contrast, the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) average premium for this region is $485 a year. Put another way, homeowners may save an average of $358 per year when purchasing <a href=\"/flood-insurance/florida/\">Florida flood insurance</a> through us instead of buying a separate flood insurance policy from the NFIP.</p>\n<h3 id=\"kinvsnfipaveragefloodinsurancepremiums\">Kin vs. NFIP Average Flood Insurance Premiums</h3>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Kin Average Premium for Florida</th>\n<th>NFIP Average Premium for Florida</th>\n<th>Kin Average Premium for Hamilton County</th>\n<th>NFIP Average Premium for Hamilton County</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>$225</td>\n<td>$563</td>\n<td>$127</td>\n<td>$485</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>These figures are averages and meant to give you a ballpark idea of how much coverage may cost in your area.

Let’s take a look at which flood zones in Hamilton County require flood insurance.</p>\n<h2 id=\"hamiltoncountyfloodzones\">Hamilton County Flood Zones</h2>\n<p>Flood Factor and FEMA’s maps are two ways to figure out your home’s flood zone. Flood Factor offers a snapshot of your home's flood history and projected flood risk; <a href=\"https://www.propertyshark.com/mason/fl/Hamilton-County/Maps/Fema-Flood-Hazard-Areas\">FEMA’s flood zone map for Hamilton County</a> offers a more technical glimpse at flood risks in the region.</p>\n<p>FEMA shows there are a number of high-risk flood zones in Hamilton County. The areas most at risk for flooding are near the Withlacoochee and Suwannee Rivers, designated as either A or AE flood zones. If your home is in one of these zones, you’re required to have flood insurance for your property if you have a federally backed mortgage.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/glossary/flood-zone-a/\">Flood zone A</a> has a 1 percent annual chance of flooding with no determined base flood elevation (the height to which flood waters are expected to rise). AE flood zones also have a 1 percent chance of flooding with a determined BFE. BFE indicates the lowest level you can build property so it's not heavily damaged by flooding.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whathamiltoncountyfloodinsurancecovers\">What Hamilton County Flood Insurance Covers</h2>\n<p>Where you buy your flood insurance matters. It dictates how much coverage you can get and how quickly you can get it.</p>\n<p>While both Kin and the NFIP flood insurance policies cover water damage from storm surges, rising waters, broken water mains, groundwater seepage, and mudslides, there are some noteworthy differences.</p>\n<p>NFIP coverage only covers your home up to $250,000 and your belongings up to $100,000. Our flood coverage matches your home insurance policy’s limits for your dwelling, personal property, and other structures.</p>\n<p>It also allows you to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Add flood insurance to your home insurance policy instead of juggling two separate policies.</li>\n<li>Have one premium and deductible for home and flood insurance.</li>\n<li>Work with one company for home and flood insurance questions and claims.</li>\n<li>Skip the elevation certificate.</li>\n<li>Get covered immediately (the NFIP has a 30-day waiting period).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As a bonus, our rates are cheaper than the NFIP for 71 percent of Florida homeowners.</p>\n<h2 id=\"reducinghamiltoncountyfloodrisks\">Reducing Hamilton County Flood Risks</h2>\n<p>Florida experiences <a href=\"https://statesummaries.ncics.org/chapter/fl/\">54 inches of rainfall each year on average</a>, meaning floods are a risk no matter where you live. Understanding your home's flood risks can help you prepare for an emergency and take steps to lower your home's risk of flooding.</p>\n<p>For example, 26 percent of properties in Jasper, Florida, are at risk of flooding. If your home is among them, you can make your home more flood-resistant and potentially lower your flood insurance rate.</p>\n<p>You might <a href=\"/blog/6-tips-for-flood-risk/\">lower your home's risk for flooding</a> by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Moving water-sensitive equipment above the property’s BFE.</li>\n<li>Keeping up on property repairs.</li>\n<li>Updating your valves so water flows out properly.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Floods are the most common natural disaster in the United States, so make a <a href=\"/blog/disaster-preparedness-plan/\">disaster preparedness plan</a> to keep your home and family safe.</p>"

    body: "<h2 id=\"howtogetfloodinsuranceinhardeecountyflorida\">How to Get Flood Insurance in Hardee County, Florida</h2>\n<p>Hardee County, Florida’s lack of development isn’t a bug – it’s a feature. Hardee County’s remote nature is part of what appeals to residents here. The area is full of hidden gems for nature lovers. Take Pioneer Park, for example. Visitors can experience Florida’s wildlife up close on an elevated boardwalk.</p>\n<p>While Hardee County doesn’t make the list of Florida’s most flood-prone regions, the county’s various rivers and creeks make flooding a real possibility. Florida has more than 11,000 miles of rivers, streams, and lakes coupled with flat terrain – a recipe for flood risk. When Florida is hit with hurricanes and tropical storms, flooding is all but guaranteed.</p>\n<p>Let’s take a closer look at <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance</a> costs in Hardee County and when you’re required to have this coverage.</p>\n<h2 id=\"hardeecountyfloodinsurancecosts\">Hardee County Flood Insurance Costs</h2>\n<p>Though <a href=\"/flood-insurance/florida/\">Florida flood insurance</a> has a reputation for being expensive, it’s actually pretty affordable in regions like Hardee County. Our average yearly premium for the region is $121, about $366 cheaper than the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) at $487 a year.</p>\n<p>That rate is particularly low in comparison to the cost of one inch of standing water in a single-family home: about <a href=\"https://www.fema.gov/media-library-data/1499290622913-0bcd74f47bf20aa94998a5a920837710/Flood_Loss_Estimations_2017.pdf\">$26,807 in repair costs</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"kinvsnfipaveragefloodinsurancepremiums\">Kin vs. NFIP Average Flood Insurance Premiums</h3>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Kin Average Premium for Florida</th>\n<th>NFIP Average Premium for Florida</th>\n<th>Kin Average Premium for Hardee County</th>\n<th>NFIP Average Premium for Hardee County</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>$225</td>\n<td>$563</td>\n<td>$121</td>\n<td>$487</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Average premiums give you a ballpark figure to start planning for your coverage needs, but remember: your flood rates will vary based on your flood zone and your home’s construction. <a href=\"/contact/\">Contact us</a> to get an accurate quote in minutes.</p>\n<p>One big driver behind Florida’s flood insurance costs is the hurricane exposure. Because the state is likely to endure a lot of tropical storms, flood insurance rates tend to reflect that risk. Here are some statistics to give you a better idea of the state’s flood risk:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Nearly 20 percent of Florida counties have experienced 50 or more flood events in the past 50 years.</li>\n<li>2.9 million single-family homes are at risk for storm surge damage from Category 5 storms.</li>\n<li>The cost to rebuild all of the above homes would be $581 billion.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Despite these risks, we can offer flood insurance that's less expensive than the NFIP for 71 percent of Florida homeowners.</p>\n<h2 id=\"hardeecountyfloodzones\">Hardee County Flood Zones</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.propertyshark.com/mason/fl/Hardee-County/Maps/Fema-Flood-Hazard-Areas\">FEMA flood zone maps</a> are excellent tools to help you understand your home’s chance of flooding. The map for Hardee County shows some high-risk flood zones: Zones A and AE. If your home is in either of these zones and you have a federally backed mortgage, you’re required to have flood insurance.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/glossary/flood-zone-a/\">Flood zone A</a> and AE both have a 1 percent annual chance of flooding. Put another way, there’s a 26 percent chance that a home in these zones would flood during the course of a 30-year mortgage.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whathardeecountyfloodinsurancecovers\">What Hardee County Flood Insurance Covers</h2>\n<p>Where you buy your flood insurance determines how much coverage you have. While flood insurance from any provider can cover water damage from storm surges, rising waters, and broken water mains, not all providers offer the same amount of coverage or cover all structures on your property.</p>\n<p>For example, our flood insurance covers your home, other structures, and your belongings. Because we add it on to your homeowners policy, we match your flood limits to your home limits. So if you have $400,000 in coverage for your home, you have that much in flood insurance for your dwelling, too.</p>\n<p>By contrast, the NFIP has more restrictive limits. It caps at $250,000 for the home and $100,000 for belongings. It doesn’t cover other structures on your property, like sheds.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtoreduceyourhomesfloodriskinhardeecounty\">How to Reduce Your Home’s Flood Risk in Hardee County</h2>\n<p>To reduce your home’s flood exposure, first you need to learn about it. Check out a tool like Flood Factor. Just type in your address to see your home’s current and projected flood risk. You can even look up your area to get a bigger picture. For example, <a href=\"https://floodfactor.com/zip/33865/33865_fsid\">17 percent of all properties in Ona</a> are at risk of flooding. It also shows that environmental changes are behind the rising risk in this area.</p>\n<p>Next you can take steps to reduce your home’s risk of flooding, like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Keep water sensitive items out of the basement or crawlspaces.</li>\n<li>Install foundation vents or a sump pump.</li>\n<li>Apply coatings and sealants to your foundation.</li>\n<li>Install gate valves on your pipes.</li>\n<li>Grade your lawn away from the house.</li>\n<li>Point downspouts away from your home.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For more disaster preparedness tips, check out “<a href=\"/blog/disaster-preparedness-plan/\">How to Make a Disaster Preparedness Plan</a>.”</p>"

Our coverage is active immediately (no 30-day waiting period like the NFIP), and you don’t need an elevation certificate to be eligible.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtoreducehernandocountyfloodrisks\">How to Reduce Hernando County Flood Risks</h2>\n<p>Flood insurance is essential for Hernando County homeowners, but it's not the only way to prepare for a flood.

Here, you’ll find plenty of forests, citrus groves, and tranquil lakes. But nature comes with a cost, and the area faces an increasingly high risk for flooding, according to Flood Factor. In the last 30 years, more than 12,000 properties have been at risk for flooding.</p>\n<p>Highlands County and so many other parts of Florida are facing increasing flood risks because of rising sea levels, shifting weather patterns, and more severe storms. As the atmosphere increases in temperature, there’s more evaporation, which creates more water during rain events. Flood Factor states that 12 percent of all Highlands County properties are at risk for flooding.</p>\n<p>That means <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance</a> is a wise investment for homeowners in Highlands County, regardless of their flood zone. Let’s take a look at average flood costs for this region.</p>\n<h2 id=\"highlandscountyfloodinsurancecosts\">Highlands County Flood Insurance Costs</h2>\n<p>On average, our Highlands County flood insurance costs $143 a year. Compare that to the National Flood Insurance Program’s average premium for this area: $472. That means homeowners can potentially save up to $329 a year with Kin.</p>\n<p>In fact, our coverage is cheaper than the NFIP for about 71 percent of Florida.</p>\n<h3 id=\"kinvsnfipaveragefloodinsurancepremiums\">Kin vs. NFIP Average Flood Insurance Premiums</h3>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Kin Average Premium for Florida</th>\n<th>NFIP Average Premium for Florida</th>\n<th>Kin Average Premium for Highlands County</th>\n<th>NFIP Average Premium for Highlands County</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>$225</td>\n<td>$563</td>\n<td>$143</td>\n<td>$472</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Remember that your flood zone is the biggest factor in how much your flood coverage costs.

Namely its weather and likelihood of flooding. Florida has the highest flood risk of any state thanks to its 11,000 miles of rivers, waterways, and streams paired with the region’s flat terrain. Add in Florida’s yearly 54 inches of rainfall, and you have a recipe for floods.</p>\n<p>Coastal regions in Florida generally have a greater risk of flooding than inland areas, but <a href=\"https://www.fema.gov/media-library-data/20130726-1803-25045-8083/st_broomein.pdf\">20 to 25 percent</a> of flood claims happen in low or moderate risk zones.</p>\n<h2 id=\"isfloodinsurancerequiredinhighlandscounty\">Is Flood Insurance Required in Highlands County?</h2>\n<p>FEMA designated flood zones with letter labels to indicate their risk level. <a href=\"https://www.propertyshark.com/mason/fl/Highlands-County/Maps/Fema-Flood-Hazard-Areas\">Highlands County’s flood map</a> reveals both A and AE flood zones, both of which are high-risk areas.

It caps coverage for your home at $250,000 and $100,000 for your belongings.</p>\n<p>By contrast, we match our flood coverage to your homeowners policy’s underlying limits. If you have $150,000 in coverage for your personal belongings, you’ll have $150,000 in flood coverage for it, too.</p>\n<p>Our <a href=\"/flood-insurance/florida/\">Florida flood insurance</a> can cover:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Electrical, cooling, heating, and plumbing systems.</li>\n<li>Appliances.</li>\n<li>Carpeting and window treatments.</li>\n<li>Built-in bookcases and paneling.</li>\n<li>Personal property.</li>\n<li>A detached garage or shed.</li>\n<li>Foundation, walls, anchorage systems, staircases.</li>\n<li>Debris removal.</li>\n<li>Filling sandbags for temporary leaves.</li>\n<li>Moving property before a flood.</li>\n<li>Home maintenance to mitigate your property's flood risks.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"/flood-insurance/florida/\">Our flood endorsement doesn't cover:</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Boathouses.</li>\n<li>Fences and retaining walls.</li>\n<li>Sea walls.</li>\n<li>Hot tubs, pools, pool equipment.</li>\n<li>Landscaping.</li>\n<li>Decks.</li>\n<li>Septic systems.</li>\n<li>Preventable moisture/mold.</li>\n<li>Cars.</li>\n<li>Earthquakes and earth movements caused by floods.</li>\n<li>Damage to personal belongings in basements and crawlspaces.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"managinghighlandscountyfloodrisk\">Managing Highlands County Flood Risk</h2>\n<p>The first step to minimizing your home’s flood risk is to understand it. Check out FEMA’s flood maps or Flood Factor, where you can type in your address and see your property’s risk at a glance. You can even see the flood outlook for your area. For example, <a href=\"https://floodfactor.com/zip/33857/33857_fsid\">33 percent of properties in Lorida, Florida</a>, are at risk of flooding. Nearly 11 percent of those are at severe to extreme risk.</p>\n<p>The next phase is to <a href=\"/blog/6-tips-for-flood-risk/\">minimize your home's flood risk</a>. You might start by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Keeping water sensitive items out of the basement or crawlspaces.</li>\n<li>Installing foundation vents or a sump pump.</li>\n<li>Applying coatings and sealants to your foundation.</li>\n<li>Installing gate valves on your pipes.</li>\n<li>Grading your lawn away from the house.</li>\n<li>Directing downspouts away from your foundation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Doing so can lower your flood risk and help keep your coverage costs down over time.</p>"

This region is home to clear springs, deep forests, and miles of rivers – a destination away from tourist traffic and the bustle of city life. But its proximity to these natural wonders also makes the area susceptible to flooding.</p>\n<p>Holmes County residents don’t have to look too far back to see how devastating flooding can be. In September 2020, a <a href=\"https://www.wjhg.com/2020/09/17/shelter-will-open-for-those-displaced-by-flooding-in-holmes-county/\">hurricane displaced many folks in Holmes County</a> and the region opened a shelter to support those whose homes were uninhabitable.</p>\n<p>It’s a reminder of how important <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance</a> is. Homeowners insurance doesn’t cover water damage from storm surges or external sources, so flood coverage is the only way to protect your home from this risk.</p>\n<p>Let’s take a look at how much flood insurance costs and when you’re required to have flood coverage in Holmes County.</p>\n<h2 id=\"holmescountyfloodinsurancecosts\">Holmes County Flood Insurance Costs</h2>\n<p>Our average flood insurance costs $204 a year in Holmes County. That’s $323 less than the <a href=\"/glossary/national-flood-insurance-program/\">National Flood Insurance Program</a>’s average for the region: $527 a year.</p>\n<p>Turns out, you can stand to save a lot of money by choosing a private insurance company like Kin for your flood coverage. A <a href=\"https://us.milliman.com/en/insight/could-private-flood-insurance-be-cheaper-than-the-nfip\">recent study</a> shows that 77 percent of homes can get lower <a href=\"/flood-insurance/florida/\">Florida flood insurance</a> rates if they work with private providers instead of the NFIP.</p>\n<h3 id=\"kinvsnfipaveragefloodinsurancepremiums\">Kin vs. NFIP Average Flood Insurance Premiums</h3>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Kin Average Premium for Holmes County</th>\n<th>NFIP Average Premium for Holmes County</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>$204</td>\n<td>$527</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Your home’s safety features and flood zone will ultimately determine what your flood coverage costs will be.

Additionally, nearly 20 percent of Florida counties have experienced 50 or more flood events in the past 24 years.</p>\n<p>Holmes County is no exception. According to <a href=\"https://www.propertyshark.com/mason/fl/Holmes-County/Maps/Fema-Flood-Hazard-Areas\">FEMA’s flood maps</a>, there are two high-risk flood zones here: A and AE. Both have a 1 percent chance of annual flooding and a 26 percent chance of flooding over a thirty year mortgage period.</p>\n<p>These flood zones exist throughout Holmes County, but some areas have a higher concentration. For example, Westville has high-flood risks thanks to its proximity to the Choctawhatchee River. According to <a href=\"https://floodfactor.com/zip/32464/32464_fsid\">Flood Factor</a>, 19 percent of the Westville’s properties are at risk for flooding. That number is expected to rise by 4.7 percent over the next 30 years.</p>\n<p>If you’re a Florida homeowner with a federally backed mortgage and live in an A or V flood zone – <a href=\"https://www.floodsmart.gov/flood-insurance/requirements\">you’re required to have flood insurance</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatholmescountyfloodinsurancecovers\">What Holmes County Flood Insurance Covers</h2>\n<p>What flood insurance covers depends on where you buy your policy. For example, our flood insurance covers your home, other structures, and your belongings from external water damage. The NFIP’s coverage only covers your home and your belongings.</p>\n<p>The amount of coverage varies, too. Because you add on our flood coverage to your homeowners policy, we match your flood limits to your underlying policy limits. So if your home is insured for $300,000, you’ll have $300,000 in flood coverage for your dwelling, too. The NFIP’s limits max out at $250,000 for the home and $100,000 for belongings.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtoprepareforafloodinholmescounty\">How to Prepare for a Flood in Holmes County</h2>\n<p>While flood insurance helps you get back on your feet after a flood, there are steps you can take before a flood arrives to minimize your losses. The best place to start is by understanding your flood risk.

While the year-round climate in Jefferson County is mild and comfortable, locals have the opportunity to experience all four seasons in this area. The <a href=\"http://www.jeffersoncountyfl.gov/p/about-jefferson\">average annual rainfall in Jefferson </a>of 57 inches comes with its pros and cons. When spring hits, Jefferson County residents experience a lively growing season. But no matter the season, there’s always the possibility of flooding.</p>\n<p>While most think of flooding during extreme events like hurricanes, prolonged rainfall is also a major cause for flooding in Jefferson County.</p>\n<p>That’s why <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance</a> is essential. Luckily, it’s easy to add on to your homeowners insurance policy with Kin. Let’s learn more about how much flood insurance costs and when it’s required.</p>\n<h2 id=\"jeffersoncountyfloodinsurancecosts\">Jefferson County Flood Insurance Costs</h2>\n<p>While many homeowners mistakenly think the only way to get <a href=\"/flood-insurance/florida/\">flood insurance in Florida</a> is through the <a href=\"/glossary/national-flood-insurance-program/\">National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)</a>, that’s not the case. In fact, you stand to save a lot by choosing a private insurer over the federal flood program.</p>\n<p>Our flood insurance for Jefferson County costs $241 a year on average. The NFIP’s average flood premium for Jefferson County is $487. That’s an average savings of $246 a year.</p>\n<h3 id=\"kinvsnfipaveragefloodinsurancepremiums\">Kin vs. NFIP Average Flood Insurance Premiums</h3>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Kin Average Premium for Jefferson County</th>\n<th>NFIP Average Premium for Jefferson County</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>$241</td>\n<td>$487</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Your flood insurance rate will vary based on your exact location and flood zone. <a href=\"/contact/\">Contact us</a> to see how much you can save!</p>\n<h2 id=\"floodzonesinjeffersoncountyflorida\">Flood Zones in Jefferson County, Florida</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.propertyshark.com/mason/fl/Jefferson-County/Maps/Fema-Flood-Hazard-Areas\">Jefferson County’s FEMA flood map</a> shows the region has three high-risk flood zones: A, AE, and VE. If your home is in any of these zones and you have a federally backed mortgage, you’re required to have flood coverage.</p>\n<p>VE flood zones indicate a coastal area that has high flood risks. Naturally, all of Jefferson County’s VE flood zones regions are in the county’s southern portion near the Gulf of Mexico. Almost the entire southern half of Jefferson County has VE, A, or AE high-risk flood zones. Most of Jefferson County’s moderate to low-risk flood zones sit in the northern or central-west regions.</p>\n<p>Peer-reviewed data from <a href=\"https://floodfactor.com/zip/32344/32344_fsid\">Flood Factor</a> shows that 14 percent of all properties in Monticello are at risk for flooding. Experts expect that figure to rise to 18.6 percent in the next 30 years. You can enter your address to see your home’s flood risk.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatjeffersoncountyfloodinsurancecovers\">What Jefferson County Flood Insurance Covers</h2>\n<p><a href=\"/home-insurance/\">Homeowners insurance</a> doesn’t cover water damage from external sources, like rain, hurricanes, rising waters, or broken water mains. But flood insurance does, and that’s why 42 percent of Florida homeowners have it.</p>\n<p>Flood insurance can help pay for flood damage to your home, belongings, and other structures. Our flood coverage limits match your homeowners policy limits. For example, if you have $200,000 in personal property coverage, you’ll also have $200,000 in flood coverage for your belongings.</p>\n<p>Flood insurance will cover you for the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>High-value items.</li>\n<li>Clothing and electronics.</li>\n<li>Electrical, cooling, heating, and plumbing systems.</li>\n<li>Household appliances.</li>\n<li>Foundation, walls, and stairs.</li>\n<li>Carpeting and window treatments.</li>\n<li>Detached garages.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Flood insurance doesn’t cover:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Boathouses.</li>\n<li>Fencing and raining walls.</li>\n<li>Sea walls.</li>\n<li>Hot tubs and pools.</li>\n<li>Landscaping.</li>\n<li>Decks.</li>\n<li>Septic systems.</li>\n<li>Moisture, mold, or mildew.</li>\n<li>Additional living expenses after your home becomes uninhabitable.</li>\n<li>Cars and other vehicles.</li>\n<li>Earthquakes and earth movements caused by floods.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It also doesn’t cover you retroactively, which is why the time to purchase flood insurance is before you need it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"planforfloodseasoninjeffersoncountyflorida\">Plan for Flood Season in Jefferson County, Florida</h2>\n<p>Florida’s hurricane season is the time of year when most floods occur. Last year saw a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/30/21726487/2020-atlantic-hurricane-season-end\">record-high number of hurricanes in Florida’s Atlantic region</a>. As FEMA says, “Anywhere it can rain, it can flood.”</p>\n<p>So it’s best to be prepared. Check out your home’s flood risks with resources like <a href=\"https://www.propertyshark.com/mason/fl/Jefferson-County/Maps/Fema-Flood-Hazard-Areas\">FEMA flood maps</a> and <a href=\"https://floodfactor.com/zip/32344/32344_fsid\">Flood Factor</a>, and <a href=\"/blog/6-tips-for-flood-risk/\">take steps to minimize your home’s risk of flooding</a>. That might mean:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Keeping up on property repairs.</li>\n<li>Updating your valves so water flows outward.</li>\n<li>Keeping water sensitive items out of the basement or crawl spaces.</li>\n<li>Installing foundation vents or a sump pump.</li>\n<li>Applying coatings and sealants to your foundation.</li>\n<li>Installing gate valves on your pipes.</li>\n<li>Grading your lawn away from the house.</li>\n<li>Pointing downspouts away from your home.</li>\n</ul>"

The river gives rise to plenty of natural springs where residents can enjoy swimming, fishing, and kayaking. But it also means 747 of the county’s 2,747 homes face the possibility of flooding, according to Risk Factor.</p>\n<p>Does that mean you can skip flood insurance altogether if you’re living in Lafayette County?

Moreover, flood risks are lower in Lafayette County than other Florida counties.</p>\n<p>But that doesn’t mean your flood risk is non-existent. Your house may not be in the 2,065 that have a <a href=\"hhttps://riskfactor.com/county/lafayette-county-fl/12067_fsid/flood\">26% chance for severe flooding</a>, but you can still experience water damage from inland flooding and <a href=\"/blog/what-is-flash-flooding/\">flash floods</a> during extreme weather.

If you live on a <a href=\"/glossary/100-year-floodplain/\">100-year floodplain</a>, then the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has likely designated your area as a Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA). This means you have to buy flood coverage if you have a federally backed mortgage. And yes, there are a number of these high-risk flood zones in Lafayette County.</p>\n<p>A quick glance at <a href=\"https://www.propertyshark.com/mason/fl/Lafayette-County/Maps/Fema-Flood-Hazard-Areas\">Lafayette County’s FEMA flood map</a> shows a large portion of the county has been designated <a href=\"/glossary/flood-zone-a/\">Flood Zone A</a>. Homes in Flood Zone A have a 1% annual chance of flooding. Over a thirty-year mortgage, that translates into a 26% chance of flood.</p>\n<p>Lafayette County also contains several areas designated as <a href=\"/glossary/flood-zone-ae/\">Flood Zone AE</a>. You’ll see these mainly along the Suwannee River.</p>\n<p>Both of these flood zones are SHFAs, so flood insurance is likely required in both of these if you have a federally backed mortgage. But you also want to protect your home from flooding. Taking a few simple steps like moving water-sensitive equipment up a level or using mulch in your garden can help <a href=\"/blog/6-tips-for-flood-risk/\">reduce your risk for water damage</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howmuchdoesfloodinsuranceinlafayettecountyflcost\">How much does flood insurance in Lafayette County, FL cost?</h2>\n<p>Let’s start by looking at the cost of <a href=\"/flood-insurance/florida/\">Florida flood insurance</a>. While Florida homeowners pay some of the highest home insurance premiums in the country, their flood insurance bills are among the lowest. In the Sunshine State, the average cost for flood insurance is <a href=\"https://www.valuepenguin.com/average-cost-flood-insurance\">$613 per year</a> when you buy from the <a href=\"/glossary/national-flood-insurance-program/\">National Flood Insurance Program</a> (NFIP).</p>\n<p>You should note, however, that flood insurance costs can vary a lot between counties, cities, and neighborhoods. Premiums may even be different for neighbors. Luckily, Lafayette County currently has a moderate flood risk, so there’s a chance your premium may be lower than the Florida average.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtogetfloodinsuranceinlafayettecountyflorida\">How to get flood insurance in Lafayette County Florida</h2>\n<p>About 90% of the flood insurance homeowners buy is purchased through the NFIP. However, one study found that going through a private insurance company like Kin could save money for <a href=\"https://us.milliman.com/en/insight/could-private-flood-insurance-be-cheaper-than-the-nfip\">77% of Florida homeowners</a>.</p>\n<p>Many of our members do save money on their flood insurance because we offer the coverage as an <a href=\"/glossary/insurance-endorsement/\">endorsement</a> to your homeowners policy.

The real issue is cost. The area’s flood risk can make coverage expensive.</p>\n<p>That’s why more homeowners are turning to Kin for their coverage. We offer flood insurance as an endorsement to their home insurance – giving you just one policy, one premium, and one deductible to manage.

As a result, many homeowners find our flood insurance is both affordable and flexible.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howmuchisfloodinsuranceinlakecounty\">How much is flood insurance in Lake County?</h2>\n<p>Many Lake County homeowners get their flood policies through the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), which cost an average of <a href=\"https://www.valuepenguin.com/average-cost-flood-insurance\">$613 per year</a>. Surprisingly, that puts the Sunshine State towards the bottom in a list of most expenses states for flood insurance.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, Lake County’s high risk for flooding could push your annual up above the state’s average. Location plays a major role in how much your flood insurance costs, particularly if your home is in a <a href=\"/glossary/flood-zones/\">flood zone</a>.

Both of these areas have a one percent chance of experiencing a devastating flood every year. That may not sound like much, but it translates into a 26 percent chance during a 30 year mortgage.</p>\n<p>Flood Zone A tends to have low elevations and are near bodies of water. However, FEMA has not determined the <a href=\"/glossary/base-flood-elevation/\">base flood elevation</a> (BFE), which is the level experts predict the one-percent flood will reach. Flood Zone AE, on the other hand, does have a BFE, and that means the area has clear guidelines for new construction and protecting homes.</p>\n<p>Either way, FEMA has declared both these flood zones to be Special Flood Hazard Areas. That means federally backed mortgage lenders will require flood insurance.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtogetaffordablelakecountyfloodinsurance\">How to get affordable Lake County flood insurance</h2>\n<p>Customers who choose to get their flood insurance from us often end up saving money on their coverage.

    body: "<p>Flood risks are rising in Florida, and Leon County is no exception. The area contains 35 square miles of wetlands, rivers, streams, and lakes that make much of the county vulnerable to flooding.</p>\n<p>Leon’s increasing flood risk makes <a href=\"/flood-insurance/florida/\">Florida flood insurance</a> more than just a bonus coverage. It’s an essential﹘and sometimes mandatory!﹘protection for homeowners in the county. Unfortunately, the county’s risk also means coverage can be expensive. Let’s take a look at what flood insurance is, how much it costs, and how you may be able to save by choosing Kin.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatisfloodinsuranceinleoncountyflorida\">What is flood insurance in Leon County, Florida?</h2>\n<p><a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">Flood insurance</a> is simply a policy that covers damage to your home, other structures on your property, and your personal belongings when it’s caused by external water sources. These <a href=\"/glossary/perils/\">perils</a> aren’t usually covered by standard home insurance, so homeowners often buy them from either the <a href=\"/glossary/national-flood-insurance-program/\">National Flood Insurance Program</a> (NFIP) or a private insurance company like Kin.</p>\n<h3 id=\"isfloodinsurancerequiredinleoncounty\">Is flood insurance required in Leon County?</h3>\n<p>You should know that homeowners in Leon County, Florida have to get flood insurance if they live in a Special Flood Hazard Zone and want a federally backed mortgage. However, most areas in Leon County have some flood risk, so getting a policy is a good investment.</p>\n<p>Even if you decide not to get flood insurance, you may want to protect yourself and your home from flooding. You could start with <a href=\"/blog/6-tips-for-flood-risk/\">taking steps to lower your home’s risk of flooding</a>, but creating a <a href=\"/blog/disaster-preparedness-plan/\">disaster preparedness plan</a> may be a smart move, too.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howmuchdoesleoncountyfloodinsurancecost\">How much does Leon County flood insurance cost?</h2>\n<p>The average flood insurance rate in Florida is <a href=\"https://www.valuepenguin.com/average-cost-flood-insurance\">$613 per year</a>. That’s actually on the lower end of the scale - which is pretty fortunate considering how much <a href=\"/blog/florida-homeowners-insurance-rates-increasing/\">Florida home insurance has gone up</a> recently. But the high flood risk in Leon County means homeowners there likely pay at least the average annual rate or more.</p>\n<h3 id=\"leoncountyfloodrisks\">Leon County flood risks</h3>\n<p>While Leon County’s flood risks aren’t as high as Florida’s coastal counties, like St. Johns or Collier, the county isn’t immune to flooding from hurricanes. Tallahassee, the county seat, <a href=\"https://emergency.fsu.edu/resources/hazards/tropical-storms-hurricanes/tropical-storms-hurricanes-history-fsu\">averages one hurricane every eight years</a>.</p>\n<p>Plus, Leon County faces flood risks in several forms, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Storm surge from hurricanes.</li>\n<li>Saturated land, overflowing rivers, and backed-up storm drains after heavy rains.</li>\n<li>Breaches in levees and dams.</li>\n<li>Flooding caused by closed basins.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A closed basin is an area where water collects but has no surface outlet to let the water out. Sometimes water in a closed basin will “pop off” to another basin, but many homes in Leon County’s closed basins were built below the level that allows that to happen.</p>\n<h3 id=\"floodzonesinleoncountyfl\">Flood zones in Leon County, FL</h3>\n<p>A glance at FEMA’s <a href=\"https://www.propertyshark.com/mason/fl/Leon-County/Maps/Fema-Flood-Hazard-Areas\">flood map for Leon County</a> shows that the region contains a number of high-risk <a href=\"/glossary/flood-zones/\">flood zones</a>, including A and AE. You should note, however, that FEMA’s maps do not account for homes in closed basins that might have a high risk for flooding, too. More importantly, being outside of a flood zone doesn’t mean your home won’t flood. FEMA estimates that <a href=\"https://www.fema.gov/media-library-data/20130726-1803-25045-8083/st_broomein.pdf\">20-25% of all flood claims</a> occur in moderate to low-risk areas.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howtosavemoneyonleoncountyfloodinsurance\">How to save money on Leon County flood insurance</h2>\n<p>Most homeowners who need flood insurance go to the NFIP, which was created to reduce the financial burden floods can create in communities. The NFIP offers standalone policies that provide up to $250,000 of coverage for your home and up to $100,000 for its contents.</p>\n<p>For comparison, our flood coverage is an endorsement you can add to your current policy. This often means it’s less expensive than the policies from the NFIP. Plus, our coverage:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Can be purchased with higher policy limits.</strong> Not only can you match your current policy’s coverage limits, but you can get flood insurance for <a href=\"/blog/what-are-other-structures/\">other structures</a> on your property.</li>\n<li><strong>Goes into effect immediately.</strong> NFIP policies do not go into effect until 30 days after they’re purchased.</li>\n<li><strong>Does not require an elevation certificate.</strong> You can’t get an NFIP policy without an elevation certificate, which can add anywhere from $170 to $2,000 or more to your total cost.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With Kin, you’ll only have to deal with one policy and one deductible. That’s zero hassle! <a href=\"https://www.kin.com/contact\">Contact us</a> to see how much you can save on your Leon County flood insurance.</p>"

    body: "<p>Homeowners in Levy County Florida know that their location on the Gulf Coast puts them at risk for hurricanes, but that isn’t the only catalyst for flooding in the area. Back in 2019, Levy had <a href=\"https://www.wcjb.com/content/news/Levy-County-homeowners-dealing-with-severe-flooding-557788621.html\">19-inches of rainfall</a> in just three days that damaged homes across the area.</p>\n<p>Flood risks aren’t only increasing in Levy County; they’re growing for all of Florida. But the damage floods cause is seldom covered by <a href=\"/home-insurance/\">home insurance</a>, which means most Florida homeowners have to get <a href=\"/flood-insurance/florida/\">flood insurance</a>, too. Unfortunately, the state’s flood risk translates into higher flood insurance premiums for many Florida residents, including some in Levy County.</p>\n<p>Cost may not be your only concern when buying flood insurance in Levy, but it’s certainly an important one. Our flood insurance is affordable while still providing the quality coverage you need to protect your home.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatislevycountyfloodinsurance\">What is Levy County flood insurance?</h2>\n<p>Flood insurance in Levy County, Florida is a policy that protects homeowners from financial loss if their homes are damaged by floodwater. Most flood insurance policies cover claims stemming from events like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Storm surge.</li>\n<li><a href=\"/blog/what-is-flash-flooding/\">Flash floods</a>.</li>\n<li>Inland flooding.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The main similarity between these <a href=\"/glossary/perils/\">perils</a> and others typically covered by flood insurance is that they come from outside of your house. Homeowners policies usually cover internal sources of <a href=\"/blog/water-damage-home-insurance/\">water damage</a>, like busted pipes, but not internal sources. This is what makes flood insurance so important in Levy County.</p>\n<p>Ready to see how Kin can help you protect your Levy County home?

Homeowners in the Sunshine State pay an average of <a href=\"https://www.valuepenguin.com/average-cost-flood-insurance\">$613 per year</a> for the coverage. That’s actually fairly cheap compared to other states.</p>\n<p>However, that’s just an average. Levy County’s location on the Gulf puts its residents at risk for hurricane flood damage, and that can mean higher-than-average flood insurance premiums.</p>\n<p>One look at <a href=\"https://www.propertyshark.com/mason/fl/Levy-County/Maps/Fema-Flood-Hazard-Areas\">Levy County’s flood map</a> is enough to see why flood coverage is a necessity. The overwhelming majority of the area has a high risk for flood, including <a href=\"/glossary/flood-zone-a/\">Flood Zone A</a>, <a href=\"/glossary/flood-zone-ae/\">Flood Zone AE</a>, and <a href=\"/glossary/flood-zone-ve/\">Flood Zone VE</a>. These areas are what the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) calls Special Flood Hazard Area where federally backed mortgages require flood insurance.</p>\n<p>We should note that Levy County homeowners outside of <a href=\"/glossary/flood-zones/\">flood zones</a> should not assume they're safe from flood damage. The county’s flood map indicates there are many areas in the county with low-to-moderate risk. The FEMA estimates that <a href=\"https://www.fema.gov/faq/low-risk-flood-zones\">25% of flood claims</a> come from areas like these.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howkinfloodinsuranceprotectsyourlevycountyhome\">How Kin flood insurance protects your Levy County home</h2>\n<p>Levy County homeowners who invest in flood insurance have two options: coverage from the <a href=\"/glossary/national-flood-insurance-program/\">National Flood Insurance Program</a> (NFIP) or from a private insurer like Kin. Both products protect you from the financial losses associated with flooding, but our <a href=\"/flood-insurance/\">flood insurance</a> is often less expensive because it comes as an endorsement to your home policy.</p>\n<p>Not only does covering flood damage via an endorsement usually cost less than an additional policy, it also means you:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Simplify your insurance coverage.</strong> Managing two different policies is complicated. Getting Kin flood insurance means you pay one premium and work with one claims process.</li>\n<li><strong>Get flood insurance limits that match your home insurance limits.</strong> The NFIP limits your coverage to just $250,000 on your dwelling and $100,000 for your personal property.</li>\n<li><strong>Can cover additional structures on your property.</strong> <a href=\"/blog/what-are-other-structures/\">Other structures</a> like a garage or shed get covered, too.</li>\n<li><strong>Have flood coverage immediately.</strong> Unlike the NFIP, we don't require a 30-day waiting period.
